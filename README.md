This project created by Scott Danesi is available for all to use.  This is an MIT license, so you can feel free to use this in DIY and commercial projects.  All we ask is that you pay it forward and help someone else if you have the ability.  If not, you can feel free to find Scott at a synth event and give him a high five.

We will be adding more formats as necessary over time.  All file formats are available to modify.  Please reach out to us via our website (https://www.hakailabls.com) if you have any questions.

These files are provided with no warranty, guarantee or anything.

Thank you!
